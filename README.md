# Tic-Tac-Toe-
HTML, CSS, JS

An introductory project into the Web Development. 
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
In the HTML section, we will first write the HTML structure and a title for the game “Tic Tac Toe.” We will link the style sheet or external CSS file in HTML for adding style property to the tags also, we will add the javascript or external js file in html for the logic behind the game.
